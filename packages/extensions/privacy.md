# Privacy Policy for Read for Speed

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2026

## Overview

Read for Speed is a browser extension that helps you speed read content using the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

**The short version:** We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. Everything stays on your device.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

- **No browsing history:** We do not track or store the websites you visit.
- **No analytics:** We do not use any analytics or tracking services.
- **No external servers:** We do not send any data to external servers.

### What We Store Locally

The extension stores the following data locally on your device using your browser's built-in storage APIs:

1. **Reader Settings (Local Storage)**
   - Reading speed (words per minute)
   - Font size and font family preferences
   - Chunk size settings
   - Other display preferences

2. **Session Statistics (Session Storage)**

This data:

- Is stored entirely on your device
- Is never transmitted to any external servers
- Is automatically cleared (session stats) when you close your browser
- Can be cleared at any time through your browser's settings

These permissions are used solely to provide the extension's functionality and not for any data collection purposes.

## Children's Privacy

Read for Speed does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.
