# Read for Speed - RSVP Reader Extension

Speed read at 300-1000 words per minute using the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique. Perfect any long form content.

## What is RSVP?

RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) is a reading method where words appear one at a time in the same place on the screen. Your eyes stop moving across lines, reducing wasted motion and increasing focus. This allows significantly faster reading with less fatigue.
