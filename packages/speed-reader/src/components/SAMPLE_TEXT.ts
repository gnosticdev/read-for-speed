export const SAMPLE_TEXT = `Speed reading is a collection of methods that attempt to increase rates of reading without significantly reducing comprehension or retention. Methods include chunking and minimizing subvocalization. The many speed reading training programs available include books, videos, software, and seminars.

The scientific consensus is that reading faster results in reading less accurately and that the average college-level reader reads at about 200 to 400 words per minute. The concept of speed reading challenges some of these assumptions by proposing techniques that suppress subvocalization and use peripheral vision more efficiently.

RSVP, or Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, is a technique that displays text one word at a time in a fixed focal position. This eliminates the need for eye movement and can significantly increase reading speed while maintaining comprehension when properly implemented.`
